# What the Markets Told Trump: How Bond Yields and Basis Trades Derailed a Tariff Plan

When the S&P 500 plunged nearly 20% post announcement of Tariffs — from 5670 to 4835 points — the headlines focused on investor panic. But Trump? Unshaken. Market volatility wasn't new to him. However, the sharp move in the 10-Year US Treasury yield, dropping from 4.51% to 3.80% between April 4th and 8th, likely caught his attention — and rightly so.

This wasn't just a blip. It was a signal.

## What Happened?

Investors flooded into the bond market, pushing prices up and yields down — a classic flight to safety. When equity markets tank, institutions often seek refuge in bonds. The fall in yields reflected a surge in demand for safer assets.

But then came the twist.

On Tuesday, the US government auctioned 3-Year Treasury bonds. In a surprising turn, there weren't enough buyers — not even at those attractive yields. Traditionally, these auctions are well subscribed, especially by countries running trade surpluses with the US. These nations, holding USD reserves, typically reinvest in US Treasuries to maintain capital efficiency. But this time, they didn't show up.

## Who Filled the Gap?

Domestic banks stepped in and underwrote nearly 20% of the auction. That's unusual and a red flag. Global buyers hesitated — possibly a direct reaction to the tariff threats.

So, what changed Trump's mind?

The bond market sent a clear message: tariffs have consequences. When foreign capital doesn't show up for US debt, financing government spending gets harder. Pausing the tariffs for 90 days wasn't just political — it was financial.

And just when things seemed to stabilize, bond prices reversed course and began falling. In Trump's words, "the bond market right now is beautiful." But why?

## Enter - The Basis Trade!

### Understanding the Basis Trade: The Hedge Fund Play

This popular arbitrage strategy involves taking opposing positions in Treasury futures and the underlying bonds, exploiting minor price differences. Hedge funds, often using significant leverage, go long on bonds and short on futures.

The catch? These trades require collateral — often bonds themselves.

When markets tumble, margin calls kick in. Hedge funds are forced to post more collateral, triggering massive bond sell-offs to meet obligations. This dynamic contributed to the sudden drop in bond prices — even as fundamentals suggested otherwise.

It was a rare moment when market dynamics overpowered politics.

## The Bigger Picture

Tariff threats may stir voter bases, but the global financial system doesn't play to applause. The moment foreign buyers hesitated at the US bond auction, it became clear: confidence in the US dollar — and in America's fiscal stability — still anchors the world economy.

Even hedge funds, leveraging "Basis Trade" strategies, found themselves caught in the ripple effects. Their forced liquidations weren't just isolated sell-offs; they were symptomatic of deeper market strain triggered by uncertainty over trade policy and international capital flow.

## What's Next?

Moving further, it would be a very interesting 90 Days, where we certainly get to see how and what the POTUS will come up with to woo the likes of stakeholders in robust yet complicated American Financial System.

# AI & ML: Reshaping Corporate Restructuring in India – Lessons from Global Best Practices

Corporate restructuring has always been a balancing act, protecting value, ensuring fairness, and working against the clock. For India, where stressed assets and insolvency cases surged after the pandemic, delays often mean lost value. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) promised time-bound resolutions, yet many cases still drag on for years.

This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are entering the picture. These technologies are not here to replace professionals. Instead, they act as powerful allies, augmenting decision-making, accelerating processes, and uncovering insights that were previously buried in mountains of data. Around the world, we are already seeing AI transform insolvency proceedings. For India, the question is not if this will happen, but how quickly.

## Financial Modeling and Valuation—From Guesswork to Data-Driven Precision

At the core of any restructuring exercise lies one crucial question: Can this company be revived, and at what value? Traditionally, professionals answer this by preparing financial models, assessing cash flows, and stress-testing assumptions. While effective, these methods take weeks and remain vulnerable to human bias.

AI-driven predictive analytics changes this dynamic. Algorithms can process financial statements, auditor reports, and market data in hours, generating early-warning signals of insolvency. The Reserve Bank of India has already shown interest in such applications, using ML to monitor banks' loan books and identify distress signals before defaults become visible.

Similarly, asset valuation, long a source of uncertainty, can benefit from ML tools that analyze comparable sales, depreciation patterns, and industry benchmarks. Imagine valuing a manufacturing plant: instead of relying only on traditional cost or income approaches, an AI model could compare thousands of past sales of similar assets, adjusted for market conditions, to produce a more accurate range. For lenders and investors, this reduces subjectivity and strengthens confidence in recovery planning.

## Due Diligence and Fraud Detection—Speed with Accuracy

Restructuring professionals often face endless files: contracts, compliance reports, financial statements, and litigation documents. Manual reviews can take weeks, delaying the resolution process. AI tools equipped with Natural Language Processing (NLP) are changing this.

By scanning thousands of pages in minutes, AI can highlight unusual clauses in contracts, flag discrepancies in financial records, and even identify compliance gaps. Global law firms already use AI-powered systems for legal due diligence, and Indian legal-tech startups are following suit.

Fraud detection is another area of impact. Under the IBC, resolution professionals must scrutinize past transactions to identify preferential or fraudulent transfers. AI excels here. By analyzing transaction histories, algorithms can quickly flag unusual payment patterns, round-tripping of funds, or atypical behaviors that warrant deeper review. In the U.S., bankruptcy courts have successfully deployed AI tools to detect fraud. Similar adoption in India could strengthen the integrity of resolution processes and protect creditor interests.

## Insolvency Resolution – Managing Complexity, Meeting Deadlines

The IBC prescribes strict timelines, 180 to 270 days for most cases. Yet, in reality, many cases overshoot this by hundreds of days, mainly due to court backlogs, complex claims, and delays in evaluating resolution plans. AI could be the game changer here.

For instance, automated case management systems could help the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) track pending cases, prioritize hearings, and schedule efficiently. AI tools can also assist resolution professionals in verifying creditor claims quickly by cross-checking them against data from information utilities and bank records.

When multiple resolution plans are submitted, AI models can simulate different economic scenarios, changes in interest rates, demand fluctuations, or commodity price swings, and test the resilience of each plan. While human judgment remains central, AI provides data-backed insights that allow committees of creditors to make more informed choices.

Even liquidation could benefit. AI-driven auction strategies, based on game theory and bidder behavior analysis, could optimize timing and lot sizing of asset sales, reducing delays and improving recoveries.

## India's Reforms—Laying the Groundwork for Tech Adoption

India has made bold reforms in recent years. The IBC consolidated fragmented insolvency laws, Information Utilities digitized loan records, and Pre-Packaged Insolvency (Pre-Packs) introduced faster pathways for MSMEs. More recently, the creation of the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) sought to centralize large NPAs for more focused resolution.

Each of these reforms has digitization at its core, which is vital for AI adoption. Information utilities, for example, create a "single source of truth" for debt data, making automated verification easier. Pre-Packs, with their short timelines, are natural candidates for AI-assisted valuation and plan evaluation. NARCL, tasked with sifting through large volumes of NPAs, could deploy AI to prioritize assets with higher recovery potential.

The foundation is there, but we need to strengthen adoption and ensure consistent, high-quality data across stakeholders.

## Global Lessons—The Road Ahead for India

We can look abroad for guidance. In the U.S., bankruptcy regulators use AI to flag fraudulent transfers, while private firms leverage ML to trade distressed debt more efficiently. In the U.K., the Insolvency Service is exploring AI case tracking to cut administrative delays. Singapore has gone further, integrating AI into insolvency assessments under its Smart Nation initiative.

The common thread across these countries is that AI is seen not as a replacement for human expertise but as an augmentation. Judges, insolvency professionals, and bankers continue to make the final calls, but with AI tools doing the heavy lifting in data analysis. India should adopt this mindset: technology as a partner, not a threat.

## Challenges—Data, Trust, and Legal Clarity

Despite the promise, hurdles remain. Data quality in India is inconsistent. Many smaller firms lack reliable financial records, limiting the effectiveness of AI. Information asymmetry continues to cause delays despite reforms like IUs.

Legal clarity is another challenge. Currently, the IBC does not recognize AI-driven analyses formally. Without regulatory guidance, courts and professionals may hesitate to rely on AI outputs. Guidelines from regulators like IBBI could help, perhaps accrediting AI tools for specific uses such as claim verification or resolution plan evaluation.

There is also the risk of algorithmic bias. If AI models are trained on skewed historical data, they may unfairly undervalue certain sectors or favor specific creditor classes. To build trust, AI must be explainable—its reasoning transparent and open to scrutiny.

## Opportunities—A New Era for Indian Restructuring

If we navigate these challenges, the benefits could be transformative. Resolution timelines could fall closer to statutory limits, recoveries could improve as valuations become more scientific, and early-warning systems could save companies from collapse before insolvency proceedings even begin.

Global investors may view India more favorably if they see a transparent, tech-enabled resolution system. Domestic professionals could reinvent themselves as data-guided strategists, differentiating themselves through tech adoption.

Above all, AI and ML can help India fulfill the original promise of IBC: timely, value-maximizing resolutions that restore faith in the system.

## Conclusion

AI and ML are no longer distant possibilities; they are tools already reshaping how the world handles corporate distress. For India, the next step is not about debating their usefulness but about scaling their adoption responsibly.

The task ahead is to balance efficiency with fairness, speed with transparency, and technology with human judgment. If stakeholders, regulators, tribunals, banks, and insolvency professionals embrace this partnership, India can set a global benchmark for tech-driven restructuring.

Corporate distress, once seen as a slow and uncertain dilemma, could instead become a pathway to timely recovery and renewed confidence. The opportunity is clear: those who adapt to AI today will be the leaders of tomorrow in India's restructuring landscape.
